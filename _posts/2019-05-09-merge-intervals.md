title: Merge Intervals
---

Question:

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

~~~
Example 1:

Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
Example 2:

Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.

Answer:

So my initial instinct for this was to sort by the start of each interval and then you would only have to compare one interval to its adjacent interval â€“ mostly due to having done some pseudocode for the similar Meeting Rooms II problem. However I didn't think about a lot of edge cases.  The biggest error I made was assuming the adjacent interval will always have a higher end value.  I fixed this with the whatToAdd variable.


```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} intervals
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var merge = function(intervals) {
    intervals.sort(Comparator);
    var mergedIntervals = [];
    var justMerged = false;
    intervals.forEach(function(interval, index, intervals){
        if (intervals.length == 1) {
            mergedIntervals = intervals;
        } else {
            if (index == 0) {
                mergedIntervals.push(interval);
            } else {
                if (mergedIntervals[mergedIntervals.length - 1][1] >= interval[0]) {
                    var whatToAdd;
                    if (interval[1] > mergedIntervals[mergedIntervals.length - 1][1]) {
                        whatToAdd = interval[1];
                    } else {
                        whatToAdd = mergedIntervals[mergedIntervals.length - 1][1];
                    }
                    mergedIntervals[mergedIntervals.length - 1].splice(1,1);
                    mergedIntervals[mergedIntervals.length - 1].push(whatToAdd);
                } else {
                    mergedIntervals.push(interval);
                }
            }
        }
    });

    return mergedIntervals;
};

function Comparator(a, b) {
    if (a[0] < b[0]) return -1;
    if (a[0] > b[0]) return 1;
    return 0;
};
```
