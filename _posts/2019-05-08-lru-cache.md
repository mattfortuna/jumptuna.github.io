title: Leetcode Problem – LRU Cache
---

Question:

Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support the following operations: get and put.

get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.

Follow up:
Could you do both operations in O(1) time complexity?

~~~
Example:

LRUCache cache = new LRUCache( 2 /* capacity */ );

cache.put(1, 1);
cache.put(2, 2);
cache.get(1);       // returns 1
cache.put(3, 3);    // evicts key 2
cache.get(2);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.put(4, 4);    // evicts key 1
cache.get(1);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.get(3);       // returns 3
cache.get(4);       // returns 4
~~~

Answer:

This was a fun problem and one Im still reasoning through to find the O(1) solution.

My solution uses an array (this.order) to maintain the order of what was most recently used.  This is necessary because objects have some weird rules for iteration especially when their keys are numbers like in the leetcode examples.  If objects maintained order like an array I think the O(1) solution would be fairly simple.  What makes my solution O(n) is finding the index of the key in this.order in the get when it is called and in the put if the user is replacing a key with a new (or I guess same) value.

Cache:

The cache is used to maintain a list of all key values added by put, until it reaches capacity.  I use order.length to check if the capacity is reached and remove the last element of order and delete the key/value from the cache if it is.

Put:

If a new unique key is being added to the cache then this is where I check to see if the cache is at capacity.

If a new key/value is added when the same key exists then that key is removed from order using splice and unshifted back onto it to represent its position as most recently used.  Then the value associated with the key is changed in cache.

Get:

If the key does not exist in the cache, return -1.

Otherwise if it does exist in the cache find the index of the key in order, splice order at that index and then unshift that element back onto order to represent its position as most recently used.  Return the value of the key.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} capacity
 */
var LRUCache = function(capacity) {
    this.cache = {};
    this.order = []
    this.capacity = capacity;
    return(this);
};

/**
 * @param {number} key
 * @return {number}
 */
LRUCache.prototype.get = function(key) {
    if (!this.cache[key]) {
        return(-1);
    }
    var indexOfKey = this.order.findIndex(function(element) {
        return element == key
    });
    var mostRecentlyUsed = this.order.splice(indexOfKey, 1)[0]; // remove element
    this.order.unshift(mostRecentlyUsed); // add this element to beginning

    return(this.cache[key]);
};

/**
 * @param {number} key
 * @param {number} value
 * @return {void}
 */
LRUCache.prototype.put = function(key, value) {
    if (!this.cache[key]) {
        if (this.order.length === this.capacity) {
            var removedKey = this.order.pop();
            delete this.cache[removedKey];
        }
        this.order.unshift(key);
        this.cache[key] = value;
    } else {
        var indexOfKey = this.order.findIndex(function(element) {
            return element === key
        });
        var removeOldItem = this.order.splice(indexOfKey, 1)[0];
        this.order.unshift(removeOldItem);
        this.cache[key] = value;
    }
    return(this.cache);
};

/**
 * Your LRUCache object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new LRUCache(capacity)
 * var param_1 = obj.get(key)
 * obj.put(key,value)
 */
```
